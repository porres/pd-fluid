### About:


**[fluid~] - soundfont player for Pure Data that uses fluidsynth.**

[fluid~] is an external for Pure Data that loads fluidsynth for a fullblown orchestra.

**FluidSynth** is a Real-Time SoundFont Software Synthesizer (see https://www.fluidsynth.org and https://github.com/FluidSynth/fluidsynth). The latest at the time of writing is v 2.1.6!

Original version (1.0) was released by Frank Barknecht in 04/04/2003. This repository and distribution aims at a new version, maybe "2.0" and onwards. Current there is no release yet.

#### Building [fluid~] for Pd Vanilla:

First you need to install  **FluidSynth** (https://www.fluidsynth.org/) in your system. You can run the makefile after that.

This project relies on the build system called "pd-lib-builder" by Katja Vetter (see: <https://github.com/pure-data/pd-lib-builder>). PdLibBuilder tries to find the Pd source directory at several common locations, but when this fails, you have to specify the path yourself using the pdincludepath variable. Example:

<pre>make pdincludepath=~/pd-0.51-4/src/  (for Windows/MinGW add 'pdbinpath=~/pd-0.51-4/bin/)</pre>

* Installing with pdlibbuilder

Go to the pd-else folder and use "objectsdir" to set a relative path for your build, something like:

<pre>make install objectsdir=../fluid-build</pre>

Then move it to your preferred install folder for Pd and add it to the path.

Cross compiling is also possible with something like this

<pre>make CC=arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc target.arch=arm7l install objectsdir=../</pre>



#### Further instructions:

#### - macOS

Download and install **FluidSynth** via homebrew (https://brew.sh/).

- "brew install fluidsynth"

After running the makefile, run the "localdeps.macos.sh" script with "fluid~.extension" as the argument. This magical script that copies the dynamic libraries into the external folder and links them correctly.



#### - Windows

Download the 32bit and 64bit **msys2** packages of **FluidSynth**:

`pacman -S mingw32/mingw-w64-i686-fluidsynth`

`pacman -S mingw64/mingw-w64-x86_64-fluidsynth`

and install the **ntldd** package:

`pacman -S mingw32/mingw-w64-i686-ntldd-git`

`pacman -S mingw64/mingw-w64-x86_64-ntldd-git` 

Then you can do with MinGW: 

`make install`

or you can also specify more options with:

`make PDDIR=<path/to/pd directory> PDLIBDIR=<path/to/output> install`

then on the MinGW shell `cd` to your lib installation dir and run the dependencies script:

for 32bit

`````
cd <to/your/lib/installation/dir>
./windep32.sh

`````

for 64bit

`````
cd <to/your/lib/installation/dir>
./windep64.sh

`````



#### - Linux

first build **fluidsynth**! Download sources from https://github.com/FluidSynth/fluidsynth/releases and get the following dependencies (shown for Debian)

`sudo apt install cmake libglib2.0-dev pkgconf`

then `cd` to your fluidsynth sources dir an do:

`````
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
sudo make install
`````

then `cd` to the sources of this repo and do

`make install`

after that run the linuxdepXX.sh script that matches the architecture of your build. This script copies fluidsynth dependencies to your fluid~ external folder. Example for 64bit:

`````
cd <to/your/fluid~/installation/dir>
chmod 775 linuxdep64.sh
./linuxdep64.sh
`````

Now the fluidsynth dependencies are copied to your fluid~ external folder.

### History and repositories:

The original code and version (1.0) of fluid~ was release by Frank Barknecht in 04/04/2003. This code is available at: <https://sourceforge.net/p/pure-data/svn/HEAD/tree/trunk/externals/footils/fluid/>.

The code was ported to Pd's API in 2016 by Jonathan Wilkes for distribution Purr Data and later modified to include "SMMF" by Albert Gräf in 2020. This is at: https://git.purrdata.net/jwilkes/purr-data/-/tree/master/externals/fluid~

This repository is a fork of Purr Data's code,with minor modifications and a port do distribute it for Pd Vanilla. This project's code resides at: https://github.com/porres/pd-fluid
